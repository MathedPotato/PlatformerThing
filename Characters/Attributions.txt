The code for some of the player controls are modified versions of the Player.gd script provided in this tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/tutorials/3d/fps_tutorial/part_one.html
This script is released under the MIT license, was originally created by TwistedTwigleg, and belongs to the Godot community.

The following scripts use this code at the indicated line numbers (there may be other segments that also derive from the above script that I have since forgotten about):
